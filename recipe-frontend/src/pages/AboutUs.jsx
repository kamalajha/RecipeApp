            And Find my Recipe is my little corner of the internet! I'm the voice,
            author, and creator behind Find my Recipe . What started as a casual
            hobby over 14 years ago in 2010 while I was working as a 
             student has now grown into a full-blown business (!!) that
            reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month, with content
            that has been featured on The Kitchn.

        <h3>I Love Food!</h3>
        <p>
          In this space, I am always sharing fresh, flavorful, (mostly) healthy
          recipes that I love to make and eat in my real, actual, every day
          life. If I wouldn’t eat it in real life, I won’t put in on the blog.
          My goal is to inspire you with food that is both approachable AND
          exciting, whether you’re cooking for yourself, your family, your
          roommates, or your friends. I want you to be so excited about these
          recipes that you eagerly await 5pm when you can go home from work and
          start cooking. On a related note, I absolutely LOVE seeing the food
          that you’re making. It will make my day if you tag @pinchofyum in your
          Instagram photos and stories! We love to shout out our favorites on
          Fridays with our Reader Awards on Instagram Stories.
